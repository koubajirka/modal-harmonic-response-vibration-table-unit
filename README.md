# modal-harmonic-response-vibration-table-unit
A preview of results from an ANSYS project regarding modal analysis and harmonic response of a testing vibration table unit.

## Description
This is a preview of my ANSYS project devoted to modal analysis and harmonic response of a testing vibration table unit.
The unit is inspired by a real testing table in a real dynamic testing facility (see image).
